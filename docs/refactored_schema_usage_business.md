# Refactored Data Model Briefing (Business)

## Why the refactor matters
- **Lean foundation.** The platform now runs on 50 core tables instead of 149, reducing operational overhead and making it faster to deliver new products without waiting on database redesigns.【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L228-L231】
- **Consistent experiences.** Shared services for parties, contacts, documents, and workflows mean every team sees the same customer, deal, and communication data, eliminating reconciliation across siloed tables.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L57-L520】
- **Future-ready flexibility.** Polymorphic link tables and configurable attributes let us add new relationship types, product features, or compliance fields by configuration rather than structural changes, keeping delivery timelines predictable.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L180-L257】

## How everyday processes improve
- **Customer onboarding.** Companies, individuals, brokers, and guarantors all live in a single `entities` table, so once a party is onboarded it can participate in any deal, receive notifications, or hold financial accounts without duplicate records.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L57-L178】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L34-L120】
- **Single source of communication truth.** Phone numbers, emails, and physical addresses attach to any business object through reusable link tables, allowing sales, operations, and servicing to rely on the same verified contact set.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L97-L155】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L122-L129】
- **Document and note sharing.** Deal packs, valuation reports, and internal notes are stored once and linked wherever needed, giving compliance and underwriting teams immediate visibility while preserving permissions through role lookups.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L401-L472】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L148-L205】
- **Financial clarity.** Charges, fees, drawdowns, and payments flow into unified transaction and allocation tables, streamlining reconciliation, reporting, and audit readiness.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L521-L659】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L167-L185】
- **Automated workflows.** The workflow suite orchestrates tasks, approvals, and notifications without custom tables per process, so introducing a new product journey is largely configuration and content rather than engineering work.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L347-L520】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L148-L205】

## What to expect during rollout
1. **Reference catalog uplift.** Business SMEs define the enumerations (statuses, roles, product codes) that populate the shared reference tables so applications present the right choices from day one.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L33-L53】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L48-L92】
2. **Party and relationship migration.** Existing customer, broker, lender, and guarantor records are merged into `entities` with relationship links that preserve their roles on historic deals, protecting audit trails while removing duplicates.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L57-L257】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L94-L120】
3. **Operational continuity.** Workflow definitions, system jobs, and audit logs are migrated so automation and compliance monitoring continue without interruption after cutover.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L347-L830】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L22-L33】【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L148-L172】

## Business outcomes
- **Faster product launches:** New offerings reuse existing tables and lookups, accelerating go-to-market and reducing regression risk.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L33-L598】
- **Improved reporting:** Consolidated transaction, workflow, and document data ensures management reporting draws from a single, reliable set of tables, reducing manual reconciliations.【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L347-L659】
- **Lower maintenance costs:** Fewer tables mean fewer bespoke migrations, simpler change control, and a clearer audit story for regulators and partners.【F:refactored_ddl.sh†L228-L231】【F:refactored_ddl.sql†L788-L863】
